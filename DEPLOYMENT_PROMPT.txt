Task: Deploy Tajweed Assessment React Application

Application Overview:
This is a React + TypeScript application for Quran Tajweed assessment. The app allows users to evaluate Quranic recitation based on various criteria including Makhraj (pronunciation), Madd mistakes, major/minor mistakes, and Waqf Ibtidaa rules.

Technical Stack:
- React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- React Router DOM for navigation
- FontAwesome icons
- Tailwind CSS (implied from build files)
- Create React App framework

Project Structure:
- Frontend: React SPA with components for assessment forms
- Build: Production-ready build files already generated in /build directory
- Configuration: Standard CRA setup with TypeScript

Deployment Instructions:

1. SETUP ENVIRONMENT:
   - Ensure Node.js 16+ is installed
   - Clone or download the project files
   - Navigate to project directory

2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. BUILD APPLICATION (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Note: Build files already exist in /build directory

4. DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:

   Option A - Static Hosting (Recommended):
   - Deploy the /build folder to any static hosting service
   - Services: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, etc.
   - Simply upload the contents of /build directory

   Option B - Local Server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Access at http://localhost:3000

   Option C - Production Server:
   - Use serve package: `npx serve -s build`
   - Or configure nginx/apache to serve static files

5. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:
   - No environment variables required
   - App runs entirely client-side
   - Surah data loaded from public/surahs.json

6. VERIFICATION:
   - App should load with header "Tajweed Assessment"
   - Surah selector dropdown should be functional
   - Assessment form sections should be interactive
   - Score calculation should work properly

Key Features to Test:
- Surah selection from dropdown
- Student information input
- Assessment criteria scoring (Makhraj, Madd, Major/Minor mistakes, Waqf Ibtidaa)
- Score calculation and display
- Form submission functionality

Files Structure:
- /src: Source code (React components, contexts, pages)
- /public: Static assets including surahs.json data
- /build: Production build (ready for deployment)
- package.json: Dependencies and scripts

Dependencies Summary:
- React ecosystem (react, react-dom, react-router-dom)
- TypeScript support
- FontAwesome icons
- Testing libraries
- Build tools (react-scripts)

Deployment Notes:
- Application is a Single Page Application (SPA)
- Requires proper routing configuration for production
- All assets are bundled and optimized in /build directory
- No backend server required - purely frontend application

For any issues, check:
1. Node.js version compatibility
2. npm install completed successfully
3. Build directory contains all necessary files
4. Static file serving is properly configured
